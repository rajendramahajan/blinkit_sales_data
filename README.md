# blinkit_sales_data
This project focuses on analyzing Blinkitâ€™s sales data using Power BI to provide meaningful insights and visualizations. The primary objective is to clean the data, create new measures for analysis, and build interactive dashboards to aid decision-making.

Key aspects of the project include:
1-Data Cleaning: Processed and prepared raw data for analysis by handling inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.

2-New Measures Creation: Developed custom measures (e.g., total sales, average order value, customer retention rates) to enhance the analysis.

3-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized sales performance across different categories, time periods, and geographic locations.

4-Customer Behavior Insights: Analyzed customer purchasing trends and identified patterns for strategic marketing and sales decisions.

5-Interactive Dashboards: Designed and developed Power BI dashboards to present key insights, allowing users to interact with the data dynamically.
